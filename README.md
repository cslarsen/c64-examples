C64 Example Programs
====================

A collection of small C64 programs that can be built with your favourite text
editor, on the command line.

Requirements
------------

  * GNU Make
  * Vice64 with x64 and c1541
  * ACME assembler

Running Examples
----------------

Type `make <filename>` without extension to compile and run it. For example
`make black`, which is a short program that sets the border and background
color to black and loops forever. You can type `make` again to run another
example, no need to stop Vice64.

In your browser
---------------

If you head over to http://vice.janicek.co/c64/ you can upload your d64-files
and see them in action (although it requires a blazing fast javascript engine
to run adequately).
